# Project Title
Unscramble Word is a single player game. In which user has to guess the scramble word being displayed on the screen by typing the unscramble word.

Now I have built this unscramble word app from one of google codelabs by learning a UDF principle parallelly. 


**UDF** - UDF is a architectural princile or a design pattern in which events flow from UI to viewmodel and states flow from viewmodel to UI. Causing UI being driven by viewmodel.



## Tech Stack
